# belly-button-challenge
This project creates an interactive dashboard using D3.js to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. It retrieves data from samples.json, generating a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs per sample and a bubble chart to visualize all OTUs. The dashboard also includes a demographic information panel that dynamically updates with each sample selection. Data for the charts is driven by sample_values, otu_ids, and otu_labels. The app is deployed via GitHub Pages, with all code and commits available in the linked GitHub repository. Deployment guidance will be provided in class.
